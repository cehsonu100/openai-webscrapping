Last year approximately 4,500 appointments at Health Services and over 700 appointments in Counseling and Psychological Services were not used because of No Shows. Each time a patient misses an appointment without providing proper notice, another student is prevented from receiving care. No Shows penalize other students who often have to wait more than 2 weeks for an appointment at Student Wellness or seek care in the community, costing them much more than it would on campus.  With this fee, we want to encourage students to be responsible and understand the impact they have on other students.

Applicants should not open envelopes that contain official transcripts.

Transcripts that include transfer credit from a different institution is not sufficient evidence of course work taken elsewhere. Fall 2023 Applicants – Submit the official transcripts from the college or university from which you earned your bachelor’s degree. If you are in progress with your bachelor’s degree, then send an official transcript showing classes earned up to this point. If you are admitted, you will be required to send a final official transcript showing the degree was earned before you begin your graduate program. Some programs may also require another transcript sent to their department. Current CSUF students or alumni do not need to request official transcripts from CSUF. Once we receive your documents, they become official records of the university; such transcripts therefore cannot be returned or reissued.
