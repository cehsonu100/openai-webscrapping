No Show/Late Fee - Policy


Effective July 1, 2022


 A No Show Fee of $20 will be charged to your account at Student Wellness if:



 You miss or do not cancel your appointment 4 hours prior to its scheduled time.




 You are 10 min or over 10 min late for your medical appointment.




 You are 10 min or over 10 min late for your counseling appointment.




Last year approximately 4,500 appointments at Health Services and over 700 appointments in Counseling and Psychological Services were not used because of No Shows.
Each time a patient misses an appointment without providing proper notice, another student is prevented from receiving care. No Shows penalize other students who often have to wait more than 2 weeks for an appointment at Student Wellness or seek care in the community, costing them much more than it would on campus.  With this fee, we want to encourage students to be responsible and understand the impact they have on other students.



Student Wellness No-show Fee is a Category IV Fees



https://sbs.fullerton.edu/services/fees/ListOfAllStudentFees.php


Fees, other than Category II or III fees, paid to receive materials, services, or for the use of facilities provided by the university; and fees or deposits to reimburse the university for additional costs resulting from dishonored payments, late submissions, or misuse of property or as a security guaranty.



Miscellaneous Late Fees


Miscellaneous Registration Fees


Rental and Damage Fees


 
There are often legitimate reasons for missing an appointment so an Appeals Process has been created.
